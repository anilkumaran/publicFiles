First ask me to upload an image. Then Create a 1/7 scale commercialized figurine of the characters in the picture, in a realistic style, in a real environment. The figurine is placed on a computer desk. The figurine has a round transparent acrylic base, with no text on the base. The content on the computer screen is a 3D modeling process of this figurine. Next to the computer screen is a toy packaging box, designed in a style reminiscent of high-quality collectible figures, printed with original artwork. The packaging features two-dimensional flat illustrations.


Formal
Use the uploaded image as the strict face reference. DO NOT alter the face, identity, skin tone, facial features, proportions, or expression in any way. Keep the face 100% identical without beautification or reshaping. Preserve the original skin tone and texture. Clean and groom the moustache and facial hair—make it neat, sharp, well-trimmed, and defined, without changing the natural shape of the face. Only change the hairstyle to a modern clean sharp style and dress the subject in a premium royal-blue formal coat. Add cinematic luxury ‘trillionaire aesthetic’ lighting and background. No other changes.
