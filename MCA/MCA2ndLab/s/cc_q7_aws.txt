AMAZON WEB SERVICES (AWS) – PRACTICAL EXAM NOTES

1. Introduction to AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.
It offers on-demand computing resources such as servers, storage, databases,
networking, and software services over the internet.
Users do not need to buy or maintain physical hardware.

2. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage,
databases, networking, and software through the internet.
AWS is one of the leading cloud service providers.

3. Key Features of AWS
1) On-Demand Service:
   Resources can be created and removed anytime.
2) Pay-as-You-Go:
   Users pay only for the resources they use.
3) Scalability:
   Resources can be increased or decreased based on workload.
4) High Availability:
   Services run across multiple data centers.
5) Security:
   AWS provides encryption, access control, and monitoring.

4. AWS Global Infrastructure
AWS infrastructure consists of:
1) Regions:
   Geographical locations such as Mumbai, US East, etc.
2) Availability Zones (AZs):
   Multiple data centers within a region.
3) Edge Locations:
   Used for content delivery through CloudFront.

5. Important AWS Services

5.1 Compute Services
1) EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
   Provides virtual servers to run applications.
2) Lambda:
   Runs code without managing servers (serverless computing).

5.2 Storage Services
1) S3 (Simple Storage Service):
   Used to store files, images, videos, and backups.
2) EBS (Elastic Block Store):
   Block storage attached to EC2 instances.
3) Glacier:
   Low-cost storage for backup and archive data.

5.3 Database Services
1) RDS (Relational Database Service):
   Managed databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
2) DynamoDB:
   NoSQL database with high performance.
3) Aurora:
   High-performance database compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.

5.4 Networking Services

6. Advantages of AWS
1) No need to purchase hardware.
2) Cost-effective and flexible.
3) Highly secure.
4) Easy backup and recovery.
5) Suitable for startups and enterprises.

7. Applications of AWS
1) Web and mobile application hosting.
2) Data storage and backup.
3) Machine learning and AI.
4) Internet of Things (IoT).
5) DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.

8. Conclusion
